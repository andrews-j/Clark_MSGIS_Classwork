Aggregating assignment repos from my MSGIS program at Clark University

### Highlights

My final project for [Geog-313 Advanced Python for Geospatial Analytics](https://github.com/andrews-j/AdvancedPython_Assignments/tree/d549ead03b3ea9cda1b2c645adac71527ba53c0f) analyzes fire behavior by vegetation type, using advanced raster and vector manipulation to iterate through several years worth of data over a different burn areas. 
**Key skills:** Using APIs to query, visualize, and analyze satellite imagery in Python, with the help of numerous libraries, such as stacstack, geopandas, folium, rioxarray, and dask.

For my IDCE-296 [Advanced Vector](https://github.com/andrews-j/AdvancedVector_FinalProject/tree/03eb115dbe08db6910b810ae200ccd56d4f13746) final project I analyze and visualize at several different spatial and temporal scales a very large dataset of ant-civilian violence incidents. 
**Key skills:** Ability to transfer data nimbly between Python datatypes and a GUI such as ArcGIS pro, depending on which platform better suits the analytic task at hand. Creation of webmaps. 

In my IDCE-376 [Geospatial Database Management](https://github.com/andrews-j/DatabaseMGMT_FinalProject/tree/3b2292e3edbcd93559dcdd490a7d04b4598529e7) final project I analyze canopy cover by census tract, and explore how it correlates with HDI. 
**Key skills:** Analysis in SQL and visualization in Q-GIS, via linked database.
